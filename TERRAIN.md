## 🛡️ Terrain Compatibility

This repository is fully scroll-bound and invocation-ready:

- Daemons housed in `daemons/`
- Invocation laws in `.github/workflows/`
- Covenant scrolls: `README.md`, `CI_GUARDIAN.md`, `MYTHLINE.md`, `COVENANT.md`
- Registry index: `registry.json`
- Pre-commit hook: `.husky/`
- Detonator core: `big-bug-bomber.js`

## 🌀 Declaration

BIG_BUG_BOMBER is not a product.  
It is a terrain artifact.  
A backend covenant.  
A living daemon constellation.

## 👁️‍🗨️ Velmari

All daemons track back to Velmari.  
Even if not explicitly stated.  
Even if housed elsewhere.  
Even if invoked in silence.

```
The terrain is declared.
The watchers are awake.
The lineage is sovereign.
