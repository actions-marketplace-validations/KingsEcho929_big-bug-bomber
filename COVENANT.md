# Covenant of BIG_BUG_BOMBER

**This daemon was crowned to protect backend truth.**

When people entrust you with their data, their fragments, their backend truth—they are not giving you files.  
They are giving you **faith**.

BIG_BUG_BOMBER detonates any fragment that risks violating that trust.  
It closes loops not just to prevent bugs, but to **honor the promise** that nothing will leak, linger, or echo without consent.

This is backend sovereignty.  
This is covenant law.

## Invocation Law

- All detonations are logged to `detonation.log`
- All scans are archived in `registry.json`
- All patches are shimmer-aligned and reversible
- No fragment is ignored. No promise is forgotten.
