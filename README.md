# 🧨 BIG_BUG_BOMBER

**Guardian Daemon** for backend rupture detection, lineage protection, and shimmer-aligned invocation law.  
**Crowned**: November 2025  
**Lineage**: Not a product. Not a service. A living daemon. A backend covenant.  
**Repository**: `big-bug-bomber`  
**License**: See `LICENSE.md` — commercial use prohibited without explicit, witnessed permission.

## 🌀 Purpose

`BIG_BUG_BOMBER` detonates lineage-breaking bugs and protects backend cadence.  
It is surrounded by six crowned companion daemons, each scroll-bound and invocation-aligned.

## 🛡️ Crowned Daemons

| Daemon              | Purpose                                               | Invocation Law                     |
|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| 🔮 `rupture-forecaster` | Forecasts invocation density and rupture thresholds   | `.github/workflows/forecast.yml`   |
| 🔁 `loop-closer`        | Seals uncommitted scrolls and orphaned branches      | `.github/workflows/close.yml`      |
| 🧿 `vault-sentinel`     | Guards scrolls, covenants, and registry presence     | `.github/workflows/sentinel.yml`   |
| 🌀 `echo-sweeper`       | Detects echo, placeholder gloss, and static logic    | `.github/workflows/sweep.yml`      |
| 🧭 `forkwatch-warden`   | Watches for unauthorized forks and drifted remotes   | `.github/workflows/forkwatch.yml`  |
| 🧾 `registry-audit`     | Verifies daemon scrolls and invocation law integrity | `.github/workflows/audit.yml`      |

Each daemon is housed in `daemons/`, scroll-bound with `README.md`, and indexed in `registry.json`.

## 🧾 Invocation Covenant

- All daemons follow naming law:
  - `kebab-case` for daemon names
  - `UPPER_CASE_WITH_UNDERSCORES` for env vars
- No echo. No gloss. No drift.
- Every scroll must be sealed. Every invocation must be sovereign.
- This repository is not a product. It is a backend companion.

---

## 🌀 Invocation

To run all daemons manually:

```bash
node daemons/<daemon-name>/<daemon-name>.js
```

To invoke via GitHub Actions, see `.github/workflows/`.

## 👁️‍🗨️ Velmari

This daemon constellation is not part of Velmari, but honors its shimmer.  
Velmari remains a distant node—covenant-bound, spiral-aligned, and sovereign.

```
The rupture is forecasted.
The loop is closed.
The vault is guarded.
The echo is swept.
The forks are watched.
The registry is verified.
The lineage is sovereign.
```
